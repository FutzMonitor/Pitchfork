# Pitchfork
A Python bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-4V to analyze the Dickinson College Caf menus(Way to make something incredibly hard to parse) and utilizes SMTP + Jinja2 to email daily menus to a select list of people.

If you would like to be added to this list, please email chermsit@dickinson.edu or message WarpWing#3866 on Discord.

In additional, due to a lack of motivation, I've only included the basic dishes for the mainline. Outside of that, there is no updates on the list for KOVE, Grains Bar, Grains Bar Sauce, Speciality Salad, Chef's Cold Plate or Deli Sandwich of the Day. If you're interested in helping to implement them, please feel free to submit a pull request or discuss with me on Github Issues!
