# Pitchfork
A Python bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-4V to analyze the Dickinson College Caf Menus and utilizes SMTP to email daily menus to a select list of people. The deployment of Pitchfork is done by setting a cronjob on Github Actions to run every morning at 8:00 AM (Send time may vary considering Github Actions add a cronjob to a queue). 

If you want to be added to this list, please email chermsit@dickinson.edu or message WarpWing#3866 on Discord.
